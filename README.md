# Poppy

`Poppy` is a Windows application that checks for NVIDIA graphics driver updates. It utilizes 'Beautiful Soup' to fetch the latest driver version from the web and compares it with the current version installed on your system.

## Prerequisites
- Visual C++ Redistributable (installed by default on most windows systems)
- Active internet connection

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download [`the latest release`](https://github.com/Austin-TB/poppy/releases/download/Beta/Poppy.exe) to your computer.

## Running the Application

To run the Driver Update Checker:

1. Double-click on `Poppy.exe` to launch the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

1. Click the "Check Update" button to fetch the current graphics driver version and the latest available version.
2. The application will display the current version installed and the latest version available from NVIDIA. It will also indicate whether an update is available.

## Improvements I'm working on
Currently working on:
- fetching the URL to download the latest driver if update is available
- doing the scraping on cloud
- front-end improvements
