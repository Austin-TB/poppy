# Poppy

`Poppy` is a Windows application that checks for graphics driver updates. It utilizes Selenium to fetch the latest driver version from the NVIDIA website and compares it with the current version installed on your system.

## Prerequisites

To run the Driver Update Checker, you need the following:

- **GeckoDriver**: This tool is required for Selenium to interact with Firefox. You can download GeckoDriver from its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Ensure that the `geckodriver.exe` file is in a directory that is in your system's PATH.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the [`Driver Update Checker.exe`](https://github.com/Austin-TB/poppy/releases/download/alpha/poppy.exe) file to your computer.

## Running the Application

To run the Driver Update Checker:

1. Ensure that `GeckoDriver` is correctly set up as described in the Prerequisites section.
2. Double-click on `Driver Update Checker.exe` to launch the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

1. Click the "Check Update" button to fetch the current graphics driver version and the latest available version.
2. The application will display the current version installed and the latest version available from NVIDIA. It will also indicate whether an update is available.
